# Project_10 - Sensor and Gesture App

*Ashley Steitz and Jacob Fritz collaborated on this project.*

---

**Description**

In Project 10, we developed an Android app using Jetpack Compose that showcases the functionality of gesture and sensors.
The app consists of two activities: Sensor Activity and Gesture Activity.

In Sensor Activity:
- Displays the user's name, location (state and city), current temperature, and the value of another chosen sensor (excluding Accelerometer and Light sensor).
- Includes a button "Gesture Playground" that supports fling operation, navigating the user to Gesture Activity upon performing a fling operation.
- Utilizes the Geocoder class to retrieve location information.

In Gesture Activity:
- Divides the activity into two fragments.
- The top fragment contains a red ball that moves with user gestures.
- The bottom fragment logs the activities performed in the top fragment.
- The red ball responds to user swipes, moving accordingly.
- Records and updates a log of gestures performed by the user.

Bonus 10%:
- Created a third activity replicating Gesture Activity, using a sensor (e.g., accelerometer) to move the ball within the fragment.

**UI Challenges:**
- Handling the live data
- Adjusting to Jetpack Compose

**Backend Challenges:**
- Learned how to work with the position and location functions.
- A lot of new content (gestures, lat, long, etc...) that was difficult to integrate using the source links at first but made sense after whiteboarding and lecture.
